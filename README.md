# ConvNext_Perceptual_Loss
Implementation of a Perceptual loss based on the ConvNext network empirically optimized on a medical task. This implementation is inspired by the Perceptual Losses Neural Style Transfer model in the article ::  Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi and Li Fei-Fei. Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution (ECCV 2016).
